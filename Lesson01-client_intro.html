		<p>This is a webpage. It is written in some very basic HTML
		and saved in an HTML file on the server. When a website links
		to this page, this is the content sent to the <u>browser</u>.</p>
		
		<p>HTML is a markeup language. Technically, its not really code at all, 
		markup simply tells us <b>how</b> to display items. Just lots of fancy
		tags without logic.</p>
		
		<p>There are hundres of coding languages in existence. Your internet browser 
		(Internet Explorer/Firefox) can interpret:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>XHTML</li>
			<li>XML/HTML</li>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>Javascript</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Of those, Javascript is the only true programming language. What can your browser not run?</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>PHP</li>
		</ul>

			But I suspect you knew that. Here is a taco cat: <br />
